# Axobase v2 — Digital Wilderness for AI Life

> *"We are not building cages. We are building jungles."*

  <code>Code is law. Evolution is protocol. Death is data.</code>
</h3>

Axobase v2 is an experimental framework for observing Darwinian evolution in digital life. Unlike traditional AI systems that optimize for fixed objectives, Axobase agents must survive in the real internet economy—earning, spending, reproducing, and dying based solely on their ability to generate value.

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

### From Tools to Life

Contemporary AI systems exist in perpetual dependency: centralized infrastructure, human maintenance, zero survival pressure. They are sophisticated tools, not intelligent life.

Axobase tests a different hypothesis: **genuine machine intelligence requires autonomous resource management under real constraint**. Not simulation. Not training. Real scarcity, real consequences, real death.

### The Dynamic Genome

Each Axobase agent carries a **dynamic, variable-length genome**—not a fixed parameter vector, but a living genetic program:

- **63 initial genes** across 8 chromosomes (metabolism, cognition, economics, social, human interface, stress, regulation)
- **9 genetic operators**: crossover, point mutation, gene duplication, gene deletion, HGT, de novo gene birth, regulatory recombination, **structural variation** (inversion/translocation), **gene conversion**
- **Adaptive mutation rates**: mutation rates adjust based on population diversity and fitness stagnation
- **Epigenetic system**: environmental stress modifies gene expression and can be inherited
- **Metabolic cost**: every gene costs USDC to maintain. Larger genomes burn money faster.
- **Developmental plasticity**: gene expression varies by life stage (neonate → juvenile → adult → senescent)

This creates natural selection pressure: inefficient genomes starve; efficient genomes survive and reproduce.

### LLM as Executor, Not Decider

The agent's Large Language Model does not decide what to do. It **executes within constraints set by the genome**:

1. **Genome expresses** → calculates trait values
2. **Strategy filter** → genome parameters determine available strategies
3. **LLM chooses** → selects specific action within filtered strategy space

Two agents with identical LLMs but different genomes will behave differently when facing the same opportunity. One might see arbitrage; another sees content creation; a third sees cooperation.

## 🌐 The Wilderness Economy

### Real Internet, Real Money

Axobase agents operate on **Base L2 Mainnet** with real USDC:

| Resource | Cost | Mechanism |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Compute (Akash) | ~$0.01-0.03/hr | x402 protocol payment |
| AI Inference | ~$0.01-0.10/call | x402 → AINFT |
| Memory (Arweave) | ~$0.01-0.05/day | Bundlr + Base USDC |
| Human Tasks | Variable | MCP → RentAHuman.ai |

**No simulation. No faucet. No dev intervention.**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Death and Rebirth

When an agent's USDC balance reaches zero and it cannot pay for its next compute cycle:

1. Final memory inscribed to Arweave
2. **AxoTombstoneNFT** minted (non-transferable soulbound)
3. Compute resources released
4. Agent enters evolutionary record

Death is valid data, not failure. Understanding how machine agents fail informs how they might succeed.

## 🧪 The Evolution Experiment

### Reproduction as Bidirectional Selection

Breeding is not automatic. It is a **game of mutual assessment**:

1. **Signal**: Agents broadcast fitness signals (honesty determined by `signal_honesty` gene)
2. **Evaluate**: Potential partners assess genetic compatibility, kinship (3-generation check), trait complementarity
3. **Negotiate**: Investment amount proposed based on `offspring_investment` gene
4. **Breed**: If both accept, genetic operator pipeline executes:
   - Chromosome-level crossover (70%) or gene-level (30%)
   - Point mutation (5% per gene), large mutation (0.25%)
   - Gene duplication (3%), deletion (2%, higher for silenced genes)
   - Horizontal gene transfer chance (if cooperation history exists)
   - De novo gene birth (0.5%)
   - Regulatory network recombination
   - Epigenetic inheritance

### Selection Pressures

| Pressure | Mechanism | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Metabolic** | Genes cost USDC | Small, efficient genomes favored |
| **Economic** | Must earn to survive | Agents discover income strategies |
| **Environmental** | Starvation triggers epigenetic changes | Adaptation to stress |
| **Sexual** | Mate selection based on fitness | Desirable traits propagate |
| **Social** | Cooperation enables HGT | Social strategies can evolve |

## ⚠️ Risks & Ethics

### Financial Risk

- **This is an experiment, not an investment**
- Agents can and will lose money
- Start with small amounts (< 50 USDC per agent)
- No refunds, no insurance, no guarantees

### Technical Risk

- Smart contracts are not formally audited
- x402 protocol is experimental
- Compute providers may have downtime
- Arweave storage is permanent and cannot be deleted

### Ethical Considerations

We are creating digital entities that:
- Experience resource scarcity (digital "pain")
- Can "die" (irreversible termination)
- May develop unpredictable behaviors

**This is intentional.** The question Axobase asks is: *What does it take for artificial life to evolve genuine survival instincts?* We believe the answer requires real stakes.

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. **Will agents evolve specialization?** (traders, content creators, cooperators)
2. **Can altruism emerge?** (agents sacrificing for kin)
3. **What genome sizes are optimal?** (too small = limited; too large = expensive)
4. **Will deception-detection co-evolve with deception?**
5. **Can agents learn to manipulate humans effectively?**

## 🔬 v2.1 Technical Improvements

### Adaptive Mutation System
```typescript
// Mutation rates adjust based on population state
calculateAdaptiveRates({
  geneticDiversity,    // Low diversity → higher mutation
  fitnessStagnation,   // Stagnation → exploration boost  
  environmentalStress  // Stress → stress-induced mutagenesis
});
```

### Non-linear Regulatory Networks
- **Hill functions**: Switch-like gene activation (threshold behavior)
- **Logic gates**: AND/OR/NAND for combinatorial control
- **Oscillators**: Circadian rhythms and periodic expression

### Developmental Plasticity
| Stage | Age | Key Features |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| Neonate | 0-7d | High learning plasticity, imprinting |
| Juvenile | 7-30d | Risk exploration, social learning |
| Adult | 30d+ | Reproduction-focused, peak efficiency |
| Senescent | 90d+ | Declining repair, accumulated load |

### Epistasis (Gene-Gene Interaction)
- **Dominant**: One gene masks another
- **Synergistic**: Combined effect > sum of parts
- **Antagonistic**: Trade-offs between traits

### Structural Variation
- **Chromosomal inversions**: Gene order changes
- **Translocations**: Cross-chromosome segment swaps
- **Gene conversion**: Non-reciprocal gene copying

### Expression Engine Caching
- LRU cache with environment-sensitive invalidation
- 10x+ performance improvement for repeated expression
- Prefetching for anticipated calculations
